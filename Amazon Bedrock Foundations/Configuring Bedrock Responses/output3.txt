=== BRIEF SUMMARY (128 tokens) ===
# AWS Lambda Overview

AWS Lambda is a **serverless compute service** that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You simply upload your code, and Lambda automatically handles the infrastructure needed to run and scale your applications.

## How Lambda Works

1. **Upload your code** as a Lambda function
2. **Set up triggers** from AWS services, HTTP endpoints, or in-app activity
3. **Lambda automatically runs** your code when triggered
4. **Pay only** for the compute time you consume

## Key Benefits for Developers

### 🚀 **Zero Server Management**

# AWS Lambda Overview

AWS Lambda is a **serverless compute service** that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You simply upload your code, and Lambda automatically handles the compute resources needed to run it.

## How Lambda Works

1. **Upload your code** as a Lambda function
2. **Set up triggers** from AWS services, HTTP endpoints, or in-app activity
3. **Lambda automatically runs** your code when triggered
4. **Pay only** for the compute time you consume

## Key Benefits for Developers

### 🚀 **Zero Server Management**
- No need to provision, patch, or maintain servers
- Focus entirely on writing code, not infrastructure
- Automatic scaling and high availability built-in

### 💰 **Cost-Effective**
- Pay only for actual execution time (billed per 100ms)
- No charges when code isn't running
- Free tier includes 1M requests and 400,000 GB-seconds per month

### ⚡ **Automatic Scaling**
- Scales from zero to thousands of concurrent executions
- Handles traffic spikes automatically
- No capacity planning required

### 🔧 **Easy Integration**
- Native integration with 200+ AWS services
- Trigger from S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, CloudWatch, and more
- Built-in security with IAM roles and VPC support

### 🌐 **Multiple Language Support**
- Python, Node.js, Java, C#, Go, Ruby, PowerShell
- Custom runtimes for other languages
- Familiar development experience

### ⚡ **Fast Development Cycle**
- Deploy code in seconds
- Built-in monitoring with CloudWatch
- Easy testing and debugging tools

## Common Use Cases

- **API backends** (with API Gateway)
- **Data processing** (ETL jobs, file processing)
- **Real-time stream processing**
- **Scheduled tasks** and automation
- **Microservices architecture**
- **Event-driven applications**

Lambda is ideal for developers who want to build scalable applications quickly without the overhead of managing infrastructure.
