User: I need help setting up secure IAM policies for my development team.
Assistant: I'll help you create secure IAM policies for your development team. Here's a comprehensive approach:

## Core Principles for Development Team IAM

### 1. **Least Privilege Access**
Start with minimal permissions and add only what's needed:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:Describe*",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. **Environment-Based Access Control**
Use resource tags and conditions to limit access by environment:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:*",
        "s3:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:RequestedRegion": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"],
          "ec2:ResourceTag/Environment": ["dev", "staging"]
        }
      }
    }

User: Should I buy Amazon stock?
Assistant: I'm an AWS Technical Assistant focused on helping with AWS services and cloud infrastructure. I can't provide financial or investment advice about Amazon stock or any other investments.

However, I'd be happy to continue helping you with your IAM policies for your development team! We were discussing secure access controls and environment-based permissions. 

Would you like me to continue with:
- Sample policies for specific AWS services your team uses
- Multi-factor authentication setup
- Role-based access patterns
- Policy testing and validation strategies

What specific AWS services does your development team work with most? This will help me tailor the IAM policies to your actual needs.
