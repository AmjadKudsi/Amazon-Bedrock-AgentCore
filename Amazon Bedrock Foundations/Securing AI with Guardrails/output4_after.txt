## Core Principles for Development Team IAM

### 1. **Least Privilege Access**
Start with minimal permissions and add only what's needed:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:Describe*",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "logs:DescribeLogGroups"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. **Environment-Based Access Control**
Use resource tags to restrict access by environment:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:*",
        "s3:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:ResourceTag/Environment": ["dev", "staging"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
