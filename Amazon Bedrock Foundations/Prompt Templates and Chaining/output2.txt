User: Please provide a brief overview of Amazon Bedrock. Include key features, use cases, pricing models, and target scenarios.
Assistant: # Amazon Bedrock Overview

## What is Amazon Bedrock?
Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that provides access to high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies through a single API. It enables you to build and scale generative AI applications without managing infrastructure.

## Key Features

### **Foundation Model Access**
- Pre-trained models from Amazon, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, and Stability AI
- Models for text, image, and code generation
- Easy model switching and comparison

### **Customization Options**
- **Fine-tuning**: Customize models with your own data
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Connect models to your knowledge bases
- **Agents**: Build AI assistants that can take actions and use tools

### **Enterprise-Ready**
- Data privacy and security (your data isn't used to train base models)
- VPC support and encryption
- AWS IAM integration
- Compliance certifications

## Primary Use Cases

- **Content Generation**: Marketing copy, documentation, creative writing
- **Conversational AI**: Chatbots, virtual assistants, customer support
- **Code Generation**: Code completion, documentation, debugging assistance
- **Document Processing**: Summarization, analysis, Q&A over documents
- **Image Generation**: Creative assets, product

User: Based on the overview you provided, can you give me more detailed information specifically about cost optimization strategies?
Assistant: # Amazon Bedrock Cost Optimization Strategies

## Pricing Model Understanding

### **On-Demand Pricing**
- Pay per token (input/output tokens priced separately)
- No upfront commitments
- Costs vary significantly by model (Claude, Llama, etc.)
- Output tokens typically cost 3-5x more than input tokens

### **Provisioned Throughput**
- Reserved capacity for consistent workloads
- Hourly pricing model
- Cost-effective for high-volume, predictable usage
- Requires minimum commitment periods

## Key Cost Optimization Strategies

### **1. Model Selection Optimization**
- **Start with smaller models**: Use lighter models (e.g., Claude Haiku vs. Claude Sonnet) for simpler tasks
- **Task-appropriate sizing**: Don't use premium models for basic tasks
- **Compare model costs**: Input/output token costs vary dramatically between providers

### **2. Prompt Engineering for Efficiency**
- **Minimize input tokens**: Use concise, clear prompts
- **Reduce output length**: Set appropriate max_tokens limits
- **Batch processing**: Combine multiple requests when possible
- **Template reuse**: Standardize prompts to avoid repetitive context

### **3. Caching and Response Management**
- **Implement response caching**: Store an
