# Amazon Bedrock Overview

## What is Amazon Bedrock?
Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that provides access to high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies through a single API. It enables organizations to build and scale generative AI applications without managing underlying infrastructure.

## Key Features

### **Foundation Model Access**
- Pre-trained models from Amazon, Anthropic, AI21 Labs, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, and Stability AI
- Models for text generation, chat, image generation, and embeddings
- No need to manage model hosting or scaling

### **Customization Capabilities**
- **Fine-tuning**: Customize models with your own data
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Connect models to your knowledge bases
- **Agents**: Build AI assistants that can take actions and use tools

### **Enterprise-Ready Security**
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- VPC support for network isolation
- IAM integration for access control
- Data is not used to train underlying models

## Primary Use Cases

- **Content Generation**: Marketing copy, documentation, creative writing
- **Conversational AI**: Chatbots, virtual assistants, customer support
- **Code Generation**: Programming assistance and code completion
- **Document Analysis**: Summarization, extraction, Q&A

## Pricing Models & Cost Structure

### **On-Demand Pricing**
- **Text Models**: Charged per input/output tokens (typically $0.0008-$0.024 per 1K tokens)
- **Image Models**: Charged per image generated ($0.008-$0.080 per image)
- **Embeddings**: Charged per input token ($0.0001-$0.0002 per 1K tokens)

### **Provisioned Throughput**
- Reserved capacity for consistent workloads
- Hourly pricing ($1.00-$10.00+ per hour depending on model)
- Better for predictable, high-volume usage

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### **1. Model Selection Optimization**
- **Choose appropriate model size**: Start with smaller, less expensive models
- **Compare model performance vs. cost**: Claude Instant vs. Claude, Jurassic-2 Mid vs. Ultra
- **Use embeddings models efficiently**: Titan Embeddings for vector operations

### **2. Token Management**
- **Optimize prompt engineering**: Shorter, more efficient prompts reduce input tokens
- **Implement response length limits**: Control output token consumption
- **Cache common responses**: Store frequently requested outputs
- **Batch processing**:
